CONTROL IQ - 
	- Purpose: Automatically adjusts insulin delivery based on CGM glucose readings.
	
	- Functionality:
		Increases basal insulin when glucose is rising or too high.
		Decreases or stops basal insulin when glucose is dropping or too low.
	
	- Glucose Thresholds:

		Below 3.9 mmol/L → Suspends insulin delivery.
		Above 10 mmol/L → Increases basal insulin.
		Predictive model prevents glucose fluctuations.
	
	
	-plots the glucose level of the user on a graph. For the range of glucose levels we can use 2 - 22mmol/L. And for the most current reading of the glucose level, use a realistic random number between the range depending 			on the previous number.

			For eg: User starts the machine for the first time. let the default value be 3.4 mmol/L , after every 30 mins let the glucose level drop by 0.20 mmol/L. After every meal, glucose level increase by 1.2 mmol/L.
				After every insulin delivery from bolus, glucose level will incrementally increase by 0.45 mmol/L every hour (maximum 3 hours). Maximum bolus duration should be 3 hours.

1) pump home screen : 
	top left - device battery
	top right - insulin fill gauge which indicates how much insulin left in the 300-unit cartridge
	IOB (Insulin on board) indicator which shows how much insulin is still active from previous bolus injection
	bottom left - Bolus button which directs to bolus calc
	bottom right - options button which provides access to ALERTS, SYS CONFIG, INSULIN DELIVERY SETTINGS.
	Tandem logo - to redirect to homescreen

2) prereqs - 
	- pump has to be charged via usb
	- hold power button until device turns on
	- can turn off via options button
	- PIN required to turn on device.

3) Insulin delivery Settings (allows users to configure how the pump administers insulin) -
	- CRUD operations for profiles made for user specific needs like varying basal rates during sleep or exercise.
	- user can create a new profile by nav to the personal profile section and entering critical settings like INPUT VARIABLES: 			basal rates, carb ratio, correction factors and target glucose levels.
	- each profile can be named on specific routines like Morning Routine or Exercise Routine.
	- once a profile is created, can perform CRUD operations on it.
	- can update the profile to increase basal insulin delivery (basal rate) during heavy workout. or decrease carb ratio for a 				heavy meal.


	MY SUMMARY:

	In the Insulin Delivery Settings screen:
	The user can perform CRUD operations on profiles.

	Each profile has 4 input variables:
	Basal rates
	Carb ratio
	Correction factors
	Target glucose levels

	Users can create different profiles (e.g., "Lunch," "Exercise," "Night"), but each profile contains these same 4 variables.

	When the User Edits a Profile
	If the user anticipates a heavier lunch, they can:
	Edit the carb ratio in the "Lunch" profile.

	Example:
	From 1:15 (1 unit per 15g of carbs)
	To 1:10 (1 unit per 10g of carbs) → More insulin per gram of carbs.

	The machine does not output anything on this screen.
	This screen is only for editing and saving profile variables.
	The actual insulin calculation and delivery will happen later when the user uses this profile during insulin administration


4) Manual Bolus 
	- user can initiate the bolus when they click on the bolus button on homescreen.
	- they can enter their INPUT VARIABLE : glucose level and carb intake manually or pull the variables from CGM	
	- the bolus calculator uses some formulas and then suggests an appropriate dose based on program settings such as insulin sens and target glucose level.
	- The pump calculates the bolus dose using the programmed profile settings:
		Carb ratio
		Correction factor
		Target glucose level
	- Users can:
		Override the suggested dose by manually adjusting it.
		Select extended boluses (Spread the dose over a period e.g., 50% immediately, 50% over 2 hours) or quick boluses 				(immediate correction).
		Cancel or stop a bolus mid-delivery.
	



	- Variables required for bolus calculation:
				
		------------------------------
		->VARIABLES COMING FROM THE PROFILE SETTINGS.
		
		- Insulin-to-Carb Ratio (ICR): 1 unit per 1g carbohydrate.
			= This comes from the profile settings and defines how much insulin is required to cover a 			           specific amount of carbs.
		
		 - Correction Factor (CF) / Insulin Sensitivity Factor (ISF): 1 unit per 1 mmol/L
			= Also from the profile, it specifies how much 1 unit of insulin lowers blood glucose.

		• Target Blood Glucose: 5 mmol/L
			= The desired glucose level that the pump aims to maintain, also part of the profile.

		-----------------------------------
		-> THESE ARE INPUT VARIABLES WHICH USER WILL PROVIDE WHEN THEY CLICK ON 			BOLUS BUTTON
	
		• Current Blood Glucose: 7 mmol/L
			=The real-time blood sugar level at the time of bolus calculation
		
		- Total Carbs (missing in the feature draft) - 50gm
			= The amount of carbs being consumed

		------------------------------------

		• Insulin On Board (IOB): 5 units
			= comes from home screen? for the first time bolus calculation use a default value of 2-5 units. After each insulin delivery IOB decreases by some units.
		
		------------------------------------
		OUTPUT

		• Total Bolus Required: 47 units
			= The final insulin dose after accounting for carbs, correction, and IOB.
		
		• Bolus Distribution Duration: 3 hours
			=The period over which the bolus is spread.
		
		• Immediate Bolus Fraction: 60%
			= The percentage of the bolus delivered immediately.





5) Starting, Stopping, or Resuming Insulin (check Control IQ section as well )  -
	

	- Starting insulin delivery = Users select a basal rate from their profile or configure from options. the pump then continuously delivers insulin at that rate until stopped.
	- stopping insulin delivery =
		 Manually =  user can stop insulin delivery through options.
		 Automatically  = The Control-IQ system can detect low glucose levels (below 3.9 mmol/L) and suspend basal delivery to prevent hypoglycemia.
	- Resuming insulin = When glucose levels stabilize, the pump automatically or manually resumes delivering insulin based on the previous basal rate or an updated profile.

	
	in a nutshell - When the pump is running, it continuously delivers basal insulin.
				When the user eats, they manually initiate a bolus.
				Control-IQ monitors glucose levels:
				If glucose drops too low, basal insulin is paused automatically.
				When glucose stabilizes, basal insulin resumes


6) Data Storage.
	- Logged Data:
		Basal Rates:
			Continuous background insulin delivery levels over time.

		Bolus Injections:
			Time and amount of manual or extended boluses.

		Insulin Duration:
			The duration over which insulin is actively lowering blood glucose (related to IOB calculations).
		
		Correction Factors:
			Details about how much insulin was delivered to correct high glucose events.	
	
	- User Access:

		Users can access this historical data through the current status screen.

		They can review:
			Recent bolus events → Time, dose, and duration.
			Basal rate changes → When Control-IQ increased or decreased basal delivery.
			CGM-triggered alerts → Suspensions or increases in insulin delivery.


		{ in a nutshell: 
		
		Every insulin event (basal, bolus, correction) needs to be logged with the following details:
			Timestamp
			Type of delivery (basal, bolus, correction, suspension)
			Insulin amount
			Glucose reading at the time
			Duration of the bolus (for extended boluses)
			IOB value after the event

		create a simple UI to display all this data.
		}



7) Errors:
 	Display alerts for common issues such as low battery, low insulin, or CGM disconnection trigger alerts that inform users of corrective actions
		Low battery → Display a pop-up warning.
		Low insulin → Notify the user to refill the reservoir.
		CGM disconnection → Display a message and temporarily suspend Control-IQ adjustments.
		
		For critical errors:
			Suspend all insulin delivery.
			Display a "Delivery Suspended" warning.
		Log the suspension event with:
			Timestamp
			Glucose level at the time
			Reason for suspension
