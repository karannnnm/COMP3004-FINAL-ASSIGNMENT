Project Description:
   This project is a simulation of the Tandem t:slim X2 Insulin Pump. The simulation demonstates the key features of the pump including:
      - Insulin Delivery: Both basal and bolus insulin injections
      - ControlIQ: Adjusts insulin delivery based on continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data
      - Profile Management: CRUD system for managing personal insulin delivery profiles (basal           rates, carb ratio, correction factor, target glucose)
      - Monitoring and Logging: Real-time feedback on battery status, insulin levels, Insulin on           Board (IOB) and glucose levels; logging of events and error handling
